**Felix Vargas Portfolio Project**

Share one technical concept that you developed greater mastery over in this project. Demonstrate how you understand that concept by sharing your mental model of the concept. Then, show how you used that concept in your project.

The idea of having variables to use consistently in various different sections of the project was a concept that I was able to grasp and understand to a high degree. I now understand that **CSS variables** are a crucial point for design decisions. In my mind, I like to think of clutter and unorganized features taking a toll on your mental input, and that in order to prevent this mental fatigue, using `:root` to reconfigure things first, then building up after that would make designing go way smoother later on. I believe that using CSS variables in a token system allowed me to get over a hurdle of needing to find out a specific measurement needed. Instead, I would check my variables, and because I made many cases depending on what I needed for every situation, I almost always defaulted on using one of my variables, be it for font size, spacing, but most importantly color.

Choose one project requirement that you found challenging and are proud of implementing. Describe what made it challenging and how you were able to implement the requirement by walking through your code as succinctly as possible. Remember that your audience does not know your code nearly as well as you do so you’ll have to break it down in a logical manner for them to quickly understand it.

I was challenged quite a bit by media queries for sure. When I began the project, I took a desktop first approach to building the website, since I had been using one of the layout websites to help me get started. After I realized that the layout website did not adhere to a **mobile-first approach**, I immediately stopped working, and had to shift a lot of effort into reverse engineering in a sense how to get my first layer of CSS to confirm to this approach. It did take a while to get back to productively adding new features, since I had to go out of my way a bit to find standard mobile measurements, and continue from there. However, after I was able to restructure things, it felt a lot more seamless moving forward, as I was able to scale up design choices, rather than having to worry about how to accommodate design choices later on with risk of heavy designs having to be reconfigured and touched on.

How did you leverage AI to assist your development of this project?

While the Marcy Lab Docs was a very good tool in understanding the key fundamentals of HTML and CSS, it was stated and made more clear when reviewing that it focuses on those fundamentals the most. Beyond that, it is up to our own design choices and ideas to find new concepts, styles, and overall clear any misconceptions by browsing the internet. That being said, at certain points there were complicated design choices that I wanted to implement, but simply did not know how to begin. From ideas such as keeping the navigation bar on top of the screen at all times, to experimenting with color designs and animations, I was able to use AI as sort of a tutor in certain areas, which in the long run prevented me from feeling frustrated. Another really good use for AI in my case was preventing a need to repeat code, instead putting that task to AI.
